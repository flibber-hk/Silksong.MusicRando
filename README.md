# MusicRando

A Hollow Knight: Silksong mod to randomize the music. The main menu music, as well as several "atomspheric" tracks
that aren't treated by the game as music (such as the bellway audio) are excluded.

Shuffle mode can be toggled in the mod menu:
* OnChange - choose a random track each time the music changes
* Chaos - choose a random track each time the game tries to set music - this is more frequent
* Consistent - like OnChange, except the same track will always shuffle to the same track (until returning to main menu)
* RandoRando - like Chaos, except only some of the time will the track change
* Disabled - no randomization

Music rando is currently in alpha, and there may be bugs.
